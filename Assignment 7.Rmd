```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### To begin, we'll load the libraries we will need to complete this assignment.

```{r, warning = F}
library(ape)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggtree)
```

#### Next, we'll import our data file and ensure each binary input is treated as its own character, and in its own columm.

```{r}
DragonMatrix <- read.table("Input/DragonMatrix.txt")
DragonMatrix[78:80, 2] <- c("100111110100100000000000101110101000001000000000011100100000111100000010011100", "100111110111000101000000011110111000001000000000011000100000111000000010011100", "100111110100110110000000101111110001000001000001001100100000111000010001011001")
DragonMatrix$V2 <- strsplit(DragonMatrix$V2, "")
DragonMatrix$V2 <- gsub("[\"c()]", "", DragonMatrix$V2)
DragonMatrix <- DragonMatrix %>% separate(V2, into = paste('V', 2:79, sep = ''), sep = ',')
```

#### Now we will apply our weights in the same fashion as done during the tutorial.

```{r}
WeightsDat<-read.csv("Weights.csv")
Weights<-paste0(WeightsDat$Weight,collapse="")
Weights<-strsplit(Weights,split="")[[1]]
WeightsNum<-rep(NA,length(Weights))
for(i in 1:length(WeightsNum)){
  if(Weights[i] %in% LETTERS){
    WeightsNum[i]<-which(LETTERS==Weights[i])+9
  } else {
    WeightsNum[i]<-Weights[i]
  }
}
WeightsNum<-as.numeric(WeightsNum)
```

#### We will plot a matrix to confirm that our data looks and behaves as we want it to.

```{r}
WtDragonMatrix<-DragonMatrix 
for (i in 1:length(DragonMatrix)){
  RepWeight<-DragonMatrix[[i]]==1
  WtDragonMatrix[[i]][RepWeight]<-WeightsNum[RepWeight]
  RepWeight<-NA
}

WtDragonDist<-dist(WtDragonMatrix,method='binary')
WtDragonDistMat<-as.matrix(WtDragonDist)
WtPDat<-melt(WtDragonDistMat)

ggplot(data = WtPDat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile()+scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

#### This matrix allows us to visualize our data and confirm we have made the necessary adjustments needed.

```{r}
WtDragonTree<-fastme.bal(WtDragonDist)
WtDragonTree$tip.label <- DragonMatrix$V1
WtDragonTree <- groupClade(WtDragonTree, .node = 157)

ggtree(WtDragonTree, layout = 'rectangular', aes(colour = group))+
  geom_tiplab(size = 2)
```


#### Highlighted in blue we see the lineage which led to our three dragons imported into the original dataset (group 1 in the figure). The remaining lineages are marked in red so as not to confuse evolutionary paths.
